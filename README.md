# Advent Calendar

A mini project to keep my Gatsby (and React) skills up while work is slow or majorly off JavaScript topics. 

This is a quick project because I have to have it done by a certain time. Holidays and work reassignment loom. Ideally, I'd have the time to have individual chanes to each day instead of as chunks (star, fir balls, trunk, and stand) and to have them transition or animate once in their "open" state. 

## Tools: 
- Gatsby / React
- React Hooks
- Styled Components
